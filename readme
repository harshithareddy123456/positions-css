elements with position absolute are removed from the document
position is static as default value
make parent relative and child absolute to make alignment wrt parent
static items will not have access to top,right,bottom,left
use relative for normal flow of documents(only when position relative is given with out giving anything
to parent then it will position according to itself)
fixed will act similar to absolute
fixed will stay intact with scroll
sticky will be similar to fixed but will scroll with us until the end of the document
